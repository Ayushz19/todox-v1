# todox

A simple (yet complex) todo app made on create-react-app, Material UI and Redux.
It also exploits features as IndexedDB and is also a PWA. Because of these reasons, the app can work completely offline. 
Since, we use IndexedDB to store the Todos, they stay right in your browser and the app is able to work without requiring a backend. 
Thus, we are able to provide dynamic functionality to the app while serving it on a static server such as github pages.

## Getting started

Getting started is really simple and all you have to do is this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jalaj711/todox-v1/

To build the app, all you have to do is to:

```
